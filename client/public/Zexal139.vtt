00:00.200 --> 00:02.970
<b>It looks like you finally figured it out, Astral.</b>

00:03.910 --> 00:07.310
<b>Sure I don't know where the Numeron Code's resting place is.</b>

00:08.310 --> 00:14.110
<b>So I made the Earth a part of the Barian World,</b>

00:14.280 --> 00:17.910
<b>to gain the power of the Numeron Code.</b>

00:18.280 --> 00:20.660
<b>Once I defeat you worms in this Duel,</b>

00:21.000 --> 00:24.800
<b>I'll obtain the entire Numeron Code.</b>

00:26.370 --> 00:29.620
<b>And then the Past and Future will be mine.</b>

00:30.220 --> 00:32.330
<b>As if I'll let you do something that!</b>

00:32.930 --> 00:36.680
<b>Don Thousand, we're definitely gonna beat you!</b>

00:37.400 --> 00:39.670
<b><i>Yuma... Shark... Astral...!</i></b>

00:39.970 --> 00:42.860
<b><i>Please... our future... please protect our future!</i></b>

00:44.040 --> 00:47.350
<b>I set one card and end my turn!</b>

00:47.710 --> 00:49.130
<b>How foolish...</b>

00:49.310 --> 00:53.660
<b>You're completely powerless before me,
who has the power of the Numeron Code.</b>

00:54.240 --> 00:58.970
<b><i>Sure, stretching out all around us is the Field Spell Card, "Numeron Network".</i></b>

01:00.310 --> 01:04.200
<b><i>With its power, this whole Duel can be rewritten.</i></b>

01:05.370 --> 01:09.080
<b><i>If something isn't done about it, our chances of Victory are...</i></b>

01:10.220 --> 01:14.300
<b>My turn. Draw!</b>

01:16.530 --> 01:20.670
<b>I activate the Spell Card "Numeron Direct"!</b>

01:26.840 --> 01:30.800
<b>This card allows me, while "Numeron Network" is activated,</b>

01:31.420 --> 01:36.620
<b>to chose Xyz Monsters with 'Numeron' in their name and 1000 or less ATK from my Extra Deck,</b>

01:36.640 --> 01:38.570
<b>and special summon 4 of them!</b>

01:39.170 --> 01:42.440
<b>I'll be Summoning 4 Numbers.</b>

01:42.550 --> 01:44.460
<b>Sa- say what, Numbers?!</b>

01:45.750 --> 01:50.040
<b>And these 4 Numbers are the ones that first fell to Earth.</b>

01:53.970 --> 01:57.510
<b>Ever watching over all these grounds, the Guardians of Earth!</b>

01:57.930 --> 02:00.340
<b>Appear, Number 4!</b>

02:03.260 --> 02:05.820
<b>Gate of Numeron - Catvari!</b>

02:08.040 --> 02:10.110
<b>That's the real Number 4!</b>

02:11.370 --> 02:15.260
<b>Come forth now! Number 3! And Number 2!</b>

02:17.020 --> 02:19.150
<b>Gate of Numeron - Trini!</b>

02:20.620 --> 02:22.930
<b>Gate of Numeron - Dve!</b>

02:24.840 --> 02:27.330
<b>And this is the ultimate perfection of "Numeron".</b>

02:27.440 --> 02:29.800
<b>Come forth, Number 1!</b>

02:34.260 --> 02:38.680
<b>When the Iron Gate from where Heaven and Hell are touching opens,</b>

02:38.730 --> 02:40.750
<b>abandon your last Hope!</b>

02:41.640 --> 02:43.880
<b>Gate of Numeron - Ekam!</b>

02:46.460 --> 02:48.480
<b>Tha- that's Number 1!</b>

02:54.880 --> 02:57.440
<b>Th- the Numbers have combined!?</b>

02:57.930 --> 03:02.040
<b>These cards are the Numbers appropriate for a God to use.</b>

03:02.150 --> 03:03.660
<b>The Gate of Numeron.</b>

03:04.440 --> 03:07.110
<b>But their Attack is only 1000!</b>

03:07.420 --> 03:09.670
<b>Yuma! You'll beat him!</b>

03:10.310 --> 03:12.000
<b>That's easy for you to say!</b>

03:12.350 --> 03:16.290
<b>All we've got on our field is the Zero Attack Ganbara Knight!</b>

03:16.640 --> 03:19.200
<b>Additionally, his effect's been negated.</b>

03:19.710 --> 03:22.730
<b>Also, there's something about those Numbers!</b>

03:23.110 --> 03:26.240
<b>Yuma, as long as there is a card on the other field,</b>

03:26.660 --> 03:31.200
<b>he can't rewrite our cards with Numeron Network.</b>

03:31.370 --> 03:32.280
<b>That's right!</b>

03:32.680 --> 03:37.150
<b>I'll have Number 1: Numeron - Ekam, attack Ganbara Knight!</b>

03:39.060 --> 03:41.750
<b>Trap activate! "Half Unbreak"!</b>

03:42.640 --> 03:46.200
<b>During this turn, the attacked monster is protected from destruction by battle</b>

03:46.310 --> 03:49.110
<b>and all damage we take is halved!</b>

03:50.860 --> 03:55.950
<b>And now, the damage pours down upon the Astral World!</b>

04:00.530 --> 04:02.310
<b>The Astral World is...</b>

04:02.980 --> 04:03.430
<b>{marker}</b>

05:58.970 --> 06:03.280

06:04.400 --> 06:06.370
<b>That's dirty, Don Thousand!</b>

06:06.460 --> 06:07.620
<b>Cool down.</b>

06:08.220 --> 06:11.550
<b>Right now, we have to endure his attacks by all means!</b>

06:11.910 --> 06:14.510
<b>Endure them? How foolish!</b>

06:14.600 --> 06:18.330

06:18.640 --> 06:21.550
<b>After a battle, by using 1 Overlay Unit,</b>

06:21.640 --> 06:24.280
<b>it doubles the Attack of my Numeron monsters.</b>

06:24.710 --> 06:28.710
<b>But your monsters have no Overlay Units!</b>

06:29.970 --> 06:32.680
<b>While I control "Numeron Network",</b>

06:33.280 --> 06:38.460
<b>Numeron Monsters don't have to use Overlay Units to activate their effects.</b>

06:38.860 --> 06:40.530
<b>Wha- What?!</b>

06:41.860 --> 06:44.130
<b>Again the light in the Network is...</b>

06:45.460 --> 06:46.600
<b>I see!</b>

06:47.090 --> 06:49.930
<b>With this effect, all of my monsters</b>

06:50.080 --> 06:52.280
<b>have their Attack doubled!</b>

06:54.470 --> 06:58.970
<b>And, my other Numbers share the same effect.</b>

06:59.310 --> 07:03.370
<b>So each time he battles, his monsters double their Attack!</b>

07:04.200 --> 07:06.220
<b>How the hell can we...?!</b>

07:06.240 --> 07:06.970
<b>Yuma.</b>

07:08.440 --> 07:12.620
<b>In order to win, we have no choice but to destroy the Numeron Network.</b>

07:12.800 --> 07:14.420
<b>But how can we...?!</b>

07:14.660 --> 07:17.620
<b>We don't even know, where that card is...</b>

07:18.080 --> 07:21.060
<b>When the effects of "Numeron Network" are activated,</b>

07:21.460 --> 07:25.460
<b>lights run along the Network stretching out over this world.</b>

07:25.460 --> 07:26.460
<b>Probably... </b>

07:27.080 --> 07:30.260
<b>... they're drawing their power from the Numeron Code,</b>

07:30.280 --> 07:32.150
<b>from where it sleeps inside the Earth.</b>

07:32.660 --> 07:37.420
<b>Which means that there is, where the actual card "Numeron Network" has to be.</b>

07:38.530 --> 07:42.350
<b>It's up to you two, Yuma, Shark!</b>

07:42.600 --> 07:44.040
<b>Astral...</b>

07:45.260 --> 07:46.800
<b>Don Thousand.</b>

07:49.680 --> 07:50.820
<b>Astral!</b>

07:54.680 --> 07:57.040
<b>It's up to you two, Yuma, Shark!</b>

07:57.530 --> 07:58.550
<b>Astral...</b>

07:58.730 --> 07:59.860
<b>How foolish.</b>

08:01.150 --> 08:05.000
<b>Even if you go after the Numeron Network itself to destroy it,</b>

08:05.440 --> 08:08.820
<b>finding it won't change anything about your defeat.</b>

08:09.600 --> 08:13.770
<b>Now, behold the true form of "Gate of Numeron"!</b>

08:15.370 --> 08:20.530
<b>Number 2: Gate of Numeron - Dve, Attack Ganbara Knight!</b>

08:26.970 --> 08:30.730
<b>Tha... that's Gate of Numeron's real form!?</b>

08:31.440 --> 08:32.750
<b>It's coming, Yuma!</b>

08:33.200 --> 08:37.750
<b>Got it! I activate Half Unbreak once again!</b>

08:51.420 --> 08:57.240
<b>And now, I activate Number 2 Numeron Dve's effect!</b>

08:57.770 --> 08:59.730
<b>Their Attack is doubled.</b>

09:01.110 --> 09:02.350
<b>Here it comes again.</b>

09:02.480 --> 09:05.150
<b>Until Astral finds the Numeron Network,</b>

09:05.200 --> 09:07.200
<b>we have to survive by any means!</b>

09:07.280 --> 09:08.240
<b>Yuma!</b>

09:08.240 --> 09:09.110
<b>Shark!</b>

09:09.800 --> 09:11.800
<b>And now, Number 3.</b>

09:11.800 --> 09:14.540
<b>Numeron Trini, attack Ganbara Knight!</b>

09:28.970 --> 09:30.800
<b>Yuma! Shark!</b>

09:31.280 --> 09:35.480
<b>I activate Number 3 Numeron Trini's effect!</b>

09:36.820 --> 09:39.400
<b>The Attack of all Numeron monsters is doubled.</b>

09:43.600 --> 09:45.550
<b>That's 8000 Attack...</b>

09:45.660 --> 09:48.130
<b>There's no way we can evade this one!</b>

09:49.660 --> 09:51.260
<b>With this, it's over.</b>

09:51.460 --> 09:54.610
<b>Disappear, Yuma. Nasch.</b>

09:55.200 --> 10:00.400
<b>I'll have Number 4: Numeron Catvari attack Ganbara Knight!</b>

10:01.620 --> 10:02.770
<b>As if I let you!</b>

10:03.020 --> 10:06.440
<b>At this moment, I activate the effect of the "Cut In Shark" in my hand!</b>

10:07.510 --> 10:11.030
<b>When a monster is attacked, that monster is tributed,</b>

10:11.350 --> 10:15.030
<b>and then "Cut In Shark" is Special Summoned from my hand in Defense Position!</b>

10:22.570 --> 10:24.290
<b>Nice save, Shark!</b>

10:28.680 --> 10:32.110
<b>Hold on, Yuma! Shark!</b>

10:33.260 --> 10:36.120
<b>So you want to prolong your end a bit?</b>

10:36.930 --> 10:41.550
<b>I activate the effect of "Number 4: Numeron Catvari"!</b>

10:41.680 --> 10:44.130
<b>The Attack doubles.</b>

10:46.060 --> 10:48.060
<b>16000 Attack?!</b>

10:48.310 --> 10:52.200
<b>That's not all. Since "Numeron Network" is active,</b>

10:52.750 --> 10:57.770
<b>I can chaosify and Rank-Up my "Number 1: Numeron Ekam".</b>

10:58.020 --> 10:59.040
<b>What?!</b>

10:59.730 --> 11:02.370
<b>I Overlay "Numeron Ekam".</b>

11:03.820 --> 11:05.840
<b>Chaos Xyz Change!</b>

11:06.310 --> 11:09.200
<b>Come forth, Chaos Number 1!</b>

11:12.390 --> 11:14.950
<b>What... What will appear this time?</b>

11:15.930 --> 11:20.150
<b>Destroy the Order of everything and let the Chaos become Darkness!</b>

11:21.000 --> 11:23.970
<b>Guide the World to it's True Form!</b>

11:24.170 --> 11:27.170
<b>Gate of Chaos Numeron Shunya!</b>

11:27.860 --> 11:28.930
<b>However,</b>

11:28.970 --> 11:33.630
<b>if there is no activated "Numeron Network", this monster is destroyed.</b>

11:34.110 --> 11:37.670
<b>And now I activate the effect of "Chaos Numeron Shunya"!</b>

11:38.170 --> 11:40.130
<b>When this Monster is summoned,</b>

11:40.350 --> 11:42.840
<b>all monsters on the field are banished.</b>

11:43.640 --> 11:45.930
<b>Also, in my next turn,</b>

11:46.020 --> 11:50.510
<b>Number 1: Chaos Numeron Shunya returns to the field.</b>

11:52.840 --> 11:53.820
<b>At that time,</b>

11:53.840 --> 11:58.330
<b>the combined Attack of the monsters banished by this effect...</b>

11:58.550 --> 12:00.510
<b>is inflicted to the opponent as damage.</b>

12:00.680 --> 12:02.240
<b>Wha- say what?!</b>

12:03.370 --> 12:08.400
<b>The combined Attack of the monsters banished by Shunya's effect is... <i>50,000</i>!<i></i></b>

12:08.710 --> 12:11.910
<b>If that guy gets his next turn, then for sure...</b>

12:12.480 --> 12:14.570
<b>... we're going to lose!</b>

12:16.680 --> 12:19.680
<b>My turn, draw!</b>

12:20.150 --> 12:22.200
<b>I Normal Summon "Bomb Shark"!</b>

12:23.020 --> 12:26.510
<b>After this guy battles, he's destroyed,</b>

12:26.880 --> 12:30.510
<b>and the total of all Attack on the field is inflicted to the opponent as damage!</b>

12:30.710 --> 12:34.330
<b>Now, I activate the Spell Card "Aqua Jet"!</b>

12:35.330 --> 12:39.730
<b>During this turn, one WATER Monster gains Attack!</b>

12:40.370 --> 12:44.400
<b>Yeah! By attacking him directly and using its effect,</b>

12:44.570 --> 12:46.910
<b>you'll deal 4000 damage to him!</b>

12:46.950 --> 12:47.880
<b>No.</b>

12:47.880 --> 12:48.530
<b>Hu?!{Hä?}</b>

12:49.150 --> 12:53.170
<b>I activate the effect of "Numeron Network"!</b>

12:53.370 --> 12:57.480
<b>Once per turn, I can send 1 "Numeron" Card from my Deck to the Graveyard</b>

12:57.480 --> 12:59.240
<b>to activate the sent card's effect.</b>

13:00.730 --> 13:05.460
<b>I send the Counter Trap Card "Numeron Writing Magic" to my Graveyard</b>

13:05.510 --> 13:07.150
<b>to activate its effect!</b>

13:08.330 --> 13:10.900
<b>When my opponent activates a Spell Card,</b>

13:11.020 --> 13:13.800
<b>I can negate that activation and effect,</b>

13:13.860 --> 13:18.020
<b>then search my opponent's Deck for a Spell Card that can be activated properly,</b>

13:18.020 --> 13:20.220
<b>and activate it on my opponent's field!</b>

13:20.910 --> 13:24.060
<b>That's the Spell Card "Surface"!</b>

13:24.660 --> 13:29.470
<b>Correct, the card you activated was "Surface" not "Aqua Jet".</b>

13:29.710 --> 13:32.280
<b>He... He rewrote that card too!</b>

13:32.460 --> 13:36.420
<b>This choses 1 Water Monster in your Graveyard</b>

13:36.730 --> 13:39.530
<b>and Special Summons it in face-up Defense Position.</b>

13:40.000 --> 13:44.010
<b>I Special Summon "Cut-In-Shark" from my Graveyard.</b>

13:47.640 --> 13:53.550
<b>And since I control other monsters than this card, "Bomb Shark" destroys itself.</b>

14:02.680 --> 14:04.080
<b>Something like this...</b>

14:04.530 --> 14:07.460
<b>And Yuma and the others keep on fighting on the field...</b>

14:09.880 --> 14:12.600
<b>Dang it, as long as "Numeron Network" is there,</b>

14:12.640 --> 14:15.280
<b>that guy is free to do with our cards...</b>

14:15.310 --> 14:16.460
<b>Don't give up!</b>

14:17.060 --> 14:19.060
<b>That Duel isn't over yet!</b>

14:19.770 --> 14:20.930
<b>Shark...</b>

14:21.440 --> 14:25.140
<b>I activate the Quick Spell Card "Surface Rank-Up"!</b>

14:25.600 --> 14:30.280
<b>When a Water Monster is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, I can activate this card,</b>

14:30.480 --> 14:33.660
<b>and add a "Rank-Up-Magic" Spell Card from my Deck to my hand.</b>

14:34.020 --> 14:36.300
<b>Here I come, Don Thousand!</b>

14:36.460 --> 14:40.150
<b>I activate "Rank-Up-Magic The Seventh One"!</b>

14:41.530 --> 14:44.370
<b>Come forth, Number 101!</b>

14:44.810 --> 14:47.770
<b>Silent Honors Ark Knight!</b>

14:51.930 --> 14:54.790
<b>I Overlay my Rank 4 "Ark Knight"!</b>

14:55.060 --> 14:59.220
<b>I reconstruct the Overlay Network with this single monster!</b>

14:59.490 --> 15:02.110
<b>Chaos Xyz Change!</b>

15:03.840 --> 15:07.070
<b>Show yourself, Chaos Number 101!</b>

15:07.280 --> 15:09.970
<b>Silent Honors Dark Knight!</b>

15:13.220 --> 15:16.530
<b>Numeron Network's effect is a once per turn effect.</b>

15:16.550 --> 15:18.880
<b>You can't rewrite another card this turn!</b>

15:19.040 --> 15:22.010
<b>And now I activate "Dark Knight's" effect!</b>

15:22.080 --> 15:25.300
<b>By sending all its Chaos Overlay Units to the Graveyard,</b>

15:25.600 --> 15:28.820
<b>I can Special Summon "Ark Knight" from the Graveyard.</b>

15:29.860 --> 15:31.600
<b>Awesome, Shark!</b>

15:31.730 --> 15:33.440
<b>If Ark Knight and Dark Knight...</b>

15:33.510 --> 15:35.660
<b>... If both of them attack...!</b>

15:35.830 --> 15:39.510
<b>Nasch, you were aiming for this from the beginning.</b>

15:40.040 --> 15:44.090
<b>That's right. I let you use the effect of Numeron Network before,</b>

15:44.090 --> 15:46.810
<b>to set up this situation.</b>

15:46.930 --> 15:51.400
<b>You're telling me you wanted me to rewrite your card!?</b>

15:52.130 --> 15:55.010
<b>This is the end, Don Thousand!</b>

15:55.220 --> 15:57.950
<b>Ark Knight, attack directly!</b>

16:00.840 --> 16:04.840
<b>Go, Dark Knight, attack him directly!</b>

16:05.490 --> 16:07.660
<b>That's the decision!</b>

16:08.170 --> 16:12.130
<b>I Special Summon "Numeron Wall" from my hand, in face-up Defense Position!</b>

16:12.460 --> 16:16.620
<b>When I take Battle Damage, I can Special Summon this card from my hand...</b>

16:17.710 --> 16:19.880
<b>and end the Battle Phase!</b>

16:19.930 --> 16:20.910
<b>What?!</b>

16:21.480 --> 16:25.310
<b>What a pity, Nasch, <i>just</i> a little more and...</b>

16:26.240 --> 16:27.910
<b>Don Thousand!</b>

16:32.570 --> 16:34.060
<b>This is it!</b>

16:37.150 --> 16:39.680
<b>This is it, I found it.</b>

16:40.170 --> 16:42.970
<b>The actual card of "Numeron Network".</b>

16:44.000 --> 16:45.820
<b>So you found it?</b>

16:51.910 --> 16:53.080
<b>Astral!</b>

16:53.510 --> 16:55.480
<b>Nice, so you got there.</b>

16:56.000 --> 17:00.240
<b>Don Thousand, this is the end for "Numeron Network"!</b>

17:00.530 --> 17:03.060
<b>You think, you can destroy that card?</b>

17:03.620 --> 17:08.170
<b>I'm going to take it away from here and bring it the Duel field!</b>

17:08.400 --> 17:11.910
<b>I see. But if this card gets destroyed,</b>

17:12.000 --> 17:16.660
<b>the massive amounts of energy accumulated here have nowhere to go,</b>

17:17.020 --> 17:21.330
<b>and the energy that already was spread through the Numeron Network,</b>

17:21.930 --> 17:25.280
<b>will flow back onto the Earth, likely causing its end.</b>

17:26.530 --> 17:27.880
<b>That's...</b>

17:28.200 --> 17:30.400
<b>Our world will be...?</b>

17:30.840 --> 17:32.310
<b>So what will you do?</b>

17:32.370 --> 17:36.680
<b>Sacrifice the Earth to save the Astral World?</b>

17:36.840 --> 17:39.660
<b>On the other hand, if Numeron Network isn't destroyed,</b>

17:39.770 --> 17:43.860
<b>during my next turn, you will take 50,000 damage</b>

17:43.910 --> 17:45.750
<b>and you will disappear, right?</b>

17:46.530 --> 17:47.680
<b>Astral...</b>

17:53.550 --> 17:56.310
<b><i>Something has to be sacrificed either way...</i></b>

17:58.040 --> 17:59.350
<b><i>So then...</i></b>

18:02.240 --> 18:03.840
<b>A- Astral?!</b>

18:08.460 --> 18:10.820
<b>Hey Astral! No way, you...?</b>

18:14.640 --> 18:16.620
<b>Yuma... Shark...</b>

18:17.330 --> 18:18.930
<b>I do believe...</b>

18:19.420 --> 18:21.000
<b>... that this card...</b>

18:23.620 --> 18:25.640
<b>... has to be destroyed!</b>

18:30.200 --> 18:32.080
<b>The card is on his field now...</b>

18:37.880 --> 18:39.880
<b>Astral, you...</b>

18:42.460 --> 18:44.820
<b>I activate Dark Knight's effect!</b>

18:45.080 --> 18:49.570
<b>This card can turn an opponent's monster into an Chaos Overlay Unit!</b>

18:49.640 --> 18:51.570
<b>Dark Soul Over!</b>

18:54.790 --> 18:58.420
<b>And now I activate the Spell Card "Depth Eruption".</b>

18:58.600 --> 19:01.950
<b>If I control a WATER Xyz Monster,</b>

19:02.530 --> 19:07.370
<b>I can destroy every card on the field!</b>

19:08.840 --> 19:10.480
<b>Shark!</b>

19:18.950 --> 19:21.220
<b>Oh, Numeron Network's...</b>

19:21.750 --> 19:23.660
<b>That's... But then...!</b>

19:27.480 --> 19:29.910
<b>Yuma, can you hear me?</b>

19:30.310 --> 19:32.000
<b>Don't worry.</b>

19:32.680 --> 19:36.000
<b>That energy, I'll take it on me.</b>

19:37.460 --> 19:38.730
<b>Astral?!</b>

19:40.350 --> 19:42.570
<b>Hey! What're you sayin' there!</b>

19:43.260 --> 19:44.840
<b>But when you take that, you...?</b>

19:45.570 --> 19:48.260
<b>No way you... were up to this from the beginning...!?</b>

19:49.600 --> 19:53.420
<b>Yuma, I entrust all the Numbers to you.</b>

19:54.460 --> 19:56.770
<b>The rest is up to you, Yuma.</b>

19:57.370 --> 19:58.800
<b>Astral...?!</b>

20:01.290 --> 20:03.950
<b>You big jerk, don't screw around like that!</b>

20:04.000 --> 20:06.950
<b>You... If you're going to sacrifice yourself,</b>

20:07.130 --> 20:09.970
<b>I'll never ever forgive you this!</b>

20:10.820 --> 20:12.730
<b>Astral!</b>

20:12.950 --> 20:15.130
<b>Fare well, Yuma...</b>

20:25.660 --> 20:28.350
<b>You... you are...?</b>

20:29.880 --> 20:31.110
<b>Eliphas!?</b>

20:31.170 --> 20:32.330
<b>Astral.</b>

20:32.950 --> 20:34.510
<b>Why are you...?</b>

20:35.160 --> 20:38.460
<b>The Astral World went down the wrong path before,</b>

20:38.460 --> 20:41.970
<b>but then new powers of "Hope" and "The Bonds of Friendship" were born.</b>

20:42.350 --> 20:44.220
<b>Due to you and Yuma.</b>

20:44.650 --> 20:46.530
<b>Eliphas... you...</b>

20:48.660 --> 20:51.950
<b>Astral, you must not die just yet.</b>

20:52.130 --> 20:54.710
<b>I entrust the future to you all...</b>

20:56.220 --> 20:57.510
<b>Eliphas!</b>

21:06.420 --> 21:08.000
<b>Tha... that's...</b>

21:08.880 --> 21:11.600
<b>Eliphas, you phony trickster.</b>

21:12.310 --> 21:14.220
<b>Why...? Just why did...?!</b>

21:16.020 --> 21:17.130
<b>Astral...</b>

21:18.240 --> 21:19.770
<b>Eliphas told me...</b>

21:20.330 --> 21:22.840
<b>... that he entrusted the future to us.</b>

21:24.080 --> 21:26.600
<b>That's why I mustn't cry.</b>

21:28.550 --> 21:31.600
<b>We now carry the hopes of countless friends...</b>

21:32.530 --> 21:34.080
<b>Yuma! Shark!</b>

21:34.660 --> 21:37.060
<b>We absolutely have to win this Duel!</b>

21:39.550 --> 21:43.110
<b>Of course! Here we go, Don Thousand!</b>

21:43.280 --> 21:45.580
<b>I activate Dark Knight's effect!</b>

21:45.710 --> 21:48.980
<b>If it's destroyed while it has Chaos Overlay Units...</b>

21:49.080 --> 21:51.260
<b>it revives itself back to my field!</b>

21:54.390 --> 21:59.620
<b>And then we gain Life Points equal to Dark Knight's Attack!</b>

22:04.580 --> 22:07.640
<b>I set 1 card face-down and end my turn.</b>

22:08.220 --> 22:09.240
<b>Shark...</b>

22:10.970 --> 22:13.240
<b>We will <i>never</i> lose!</b>

22:14.380 --> 22:16.200
<b>Don Thousand!</b>

22:19.590 --> 22:20.310
<b>{marker}</b>

22:20.310 --> 22:21.960
<b>In the present, past and future,</b>

22:21.960 --> 22:26.360
<b>We are wishing upon the shards of dreams</b>

22:26.420 --> 22:28.680
<b>'Til we can grab hold of them</b>

22:28.700 --> 22:32.310
<b>Challenge the GAME!</b>

22:34.080 --> 22:34.930
<b>Let it go.</b>

22:45.340 --> 22:48.220
<b>When there's a problem that can't be beaten,</b>

22:49.080 --> 22:53.430
<b>We'll just try again.</b>

22:55.330 --> 22:59.340
<b>You keep holding your heart inside your chest</b>

22:59.340 --> 23:04.680
<b>It's the power you get from keeping the faith.</b>

23:04.830 --> 23:09.510
<b>Even while you're discouraged and crying</b>

23:09.930 --> 23:15.420
<b>Let's try to secure tomorrow with our bonds</b>

23:15.680 --> 23:17.580
<b>We can shatter anything</b>

23:17.580 --> 23:21.950
<b>Fear and fate and even the most fervent fantasies</b>

23:22.250 --> 23:25.830
<b>Keep on burning as you break through!</b>

23:25.930 --> 23:27.580
<b>In the Present, Past and Future</b>

23:27.650 --> 23:32.050
<b>We are wishing upon the shards of dreams</b>

23:32.130 --> 23:34.180
<b>Let's go and reach out</b>

23:34.340 --> 23:37.000
<b>Beyond the limits</b>

23:37.150 --> 23:39.440
<b>'Til we can grab hold of them,</b>

23:39.440 --> 23:42.950
<b>Challenge the GAME</b>

23:50.640 --> 23:55.350
<b>Even though the Numeron Network was destroyed, it only provided a moment of rest.</b>

23:55.820 --> 24:01.260
<b>To decide his self-rightosly called <i>Duel of God</i> for himself, Don Thousand releases an even greater power!</b>

24:01.420 --> 24:03.480
<b>Chaos Numbers 1000, you say?!</b>

24:03.480 --> 24:05.060
<b>You... Kaito, is that you?</b>

24:05.080 --> 24:06.710
<b>Even after death, you still...?</b>

24:06.710 --> 24:09.130
<b>Yuma! It's time we shred that bastard!</b>

24:09.460 --> 24:11.620
<b>Next Time, on Yu-Gi-Oh ZeXaL II!</b>

24:11.620 --> 24:14.910
<b>"Our Feelings are as One! The Dragon of Creation, Numeron Dragon"</b>

24:15.220 --> 24:18.710
<b>I won't give up until the very end!</b>
